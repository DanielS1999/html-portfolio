<H1>The best movies according to Daniel</H1>

<h2>My top 3 movies this year</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>It was very interesting and informative</p>

<h3>Spiderman across the multi-verse</h3>

<p>It was really a good quality film since I don't usually like animated</p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>

<p>I really didn't like it. TOO WOKE for me</p>
